⚠️ REAL-TIME UPDATES NOT AVAILABLE YET

Current Situation:
- HTTP server running at http://localhost:8000
- Serving OLD built version from dist/ folder
- Your SOURCE CHANGES are in src/components/ but NOT built yet

Why No Real-Time Updates?
- The static HTTP server (Python) only serves pre-built files
- Source files need to be compiled/built first
- Real-time development server requires Node.js

SOLUTION: Install Node.js and use dev server

1. Install Node.js:
   - Visit: https://nodejs.org/ (download LTS)
   - OR: brew install node

2. Setup:
   ./scripts/setup-all-dependencies.sh

3. Start dev server (real-time updates!):
   pnpm dev
   → Opens at http://localhost:5173 with hot reload

Alternative: Rebuild manually
- After Node.js installed: pnpm build
- Then refresh http://localhost:8000
