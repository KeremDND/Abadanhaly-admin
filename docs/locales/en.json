  "contact.faq.1.question": "Why buy a carpet?",
  "contact.faq.1.answer": "Carpets provide warmth, comfort, sound insulation, and aesthetic appeal to any space. They also help define areas in open floor plans and can increase the value of your home.",
  "contact.faq.2.question": "What is knot density and why does it matter?",
  "contact.faq.2.answer": "Knot density refers to the number of knots per square meter. Higher density typically means better quality, durability, and more detailed patterns. Our carpets range from 300 to 500+ knots per square meter.",
  "contact.faq.3.question": "Where should I use different types of carpets?",
  "contact.faq.3.answer": "Living rooms benefit from larger, statement pieces. Bedrooms work well with softer textures. High-traffic areas need durable, lower-pile carpets. Bathrooms and kitchens require moisture-resistant materials.",
  "contact.faq.4.question": "What should I look for when buying a carpet?",
  "contact.faq.4.answer": "Consider the room size, traffic level, color scheme, material quality, knot density, and maintenance requirements. Also think about your lifestyle - pets and children may require more durable options.",
